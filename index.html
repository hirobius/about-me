      Short Bio
    </h1>
    <p>
      Work-wise, Iâ€™m into Layout, Typography, Motion and designing micro-interactions. I really enjoy 3D sculpting in my
      spare time outside of learning to code. All-around multifaceted skillset. Attention to detail, simplicity and
      transparency are pretty high up on my list. Music all the time. Motorcycles (Trackers, Scramblers, Choppers and
      Cruisers). Xbox. WA Air National Guard.
